(What separates a mixin from multiple inheritance? Is it just a matter of semantics?)
(Mixins is a concept in Programming in which the class provides functionalities but it is not meant to be used for instantiation. Main purpose of Mixins is to provide functionalities which are standalone and it would be best if the mixins itself do not have inheritance with other mixins and also avoid state. In languages such as Ruby, there is some direct language support but for Python, there isn't. However, you could used multi-class inheritance to execute the functionality provided in Python.

I watched this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_uKI2NOLEM to understand the basics of mixins. It is quite useful for a beginner to understand the basics of mixins and how they work and the problems you might face in implementing them.
